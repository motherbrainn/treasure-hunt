# Treasure Hunt

Facilitates a scavenger hunt like game where you can print out physical copies of QR codes and post them around town. When the QR codes are scanned it notifies the user if the code is a 'winner'.  

Use the admin board to:
Generate PDF with QR Codes (for printing)
Select new winning QR code
Add additional QR codes
Delete QR Codes

This project was kind of an excuse to play with Vercel's new App Router which is what it's based around.

I'm also testing out the new vercel postgres db here.
